Python automation tool that reduces repetitive transcript access from 9-12 clicks per student to a single automated sequence, preventing RSI and saving approximately 20 hours annually.

**Tech Stack:** Python, PyAutoGUI  
**Impact:** Eliminates 200+ clicks per day, reduces cognitive load from repetitive tasks, template adaptable to other administrative workflows

### CIFAR-10 MLP Baseline
[View Project](https://github.com/hmierz/CIFAR-10-MLP-Baseline)

Explores how simple multilayer perceptrons perform on image classification tasks as a baseline before introducing convolutional architectures. Analyzes model performance, overfitting patterns, and architectural trade-offs.

**Tech Stack:** Python, Neural Networks, Image Classification  
**Focus:** Establishing performance benchmarks for deep learning model comparison

### Training a Baseline CNN on Sports Balls
[View Project](https://github.com/hmierz/Training-a-Baseline-CNN-on-Sports-Balls)

Builds and trains a convolutional neural network to classify sports balls by type using a labeled image dataset. Includes detailed performance analysis, confusion matrices, and per-class accuracy breakdowns.

**Tech Stack:** Python, CNNs, Computer Vision, Data Augmentation  
**Focus:** Image classification, model evaluation, class imbalance handling

## Additional Projects
